What you are seeing here is called "The Game Of Life", which is a type of "cellualr automata", something I find very interesting. You can read more about cellular automata <a href = 'http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CellularAutomaton.html' terget = "_blank"> here </a>  It a grid that is made up of multiple "cells", each of which has its own "state", which will evolve 
  based on a few rules.

<h1>Okay, cool. So how does this work? What are the "rules"?</h1>
